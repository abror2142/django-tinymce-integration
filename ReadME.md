# Django TinyMCE Integration using django-tinymce!

## About the Project:

This project integrates the WYSIWYG Editor - TinyMCE - to the Django project.

We can easily get WYSIWYG Editor using the [django-tinymce](https://django-tinymce.readthedocs.io/en/) library.

However, the challange (at least I faced) is to handle the image upload functions which are useful for storing content.

This Project includes features:
 - django-tinymce image upload functions
    - option for storing in Base64 encoded format
    - option for storing as a file in the media directory.
  - Image deletion after removing the image from the editor(during updates).

** I do not own anything in this repo. Thanks to people who write tutorials which I used extensively.
** Basically, I tried to connect them to test and use it for personal projects.
** FEEL FREE to give feedback :)
